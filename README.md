# GuardianPoliceKillings
Full 2015/2016 Guardian CSV files for police killings 


For docu on what the various columns mean see the well done writeup by 538 @ https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/blob/master/police-killings/README.md

This repo is only meant as a source for the full csv files since the 538 csv only contains data from 1/1/2015 - 6/2/2015
